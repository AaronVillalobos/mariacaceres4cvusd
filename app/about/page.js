                    <p>I have been a resident of the district for over 19 years. My family attended Grovecenter Elementary, Traweek Middle School, and graduated from Covina High School and South Hills High School.</p>
                    <p>From a very early age, I dreamed of becoming a teacher and learned early on that an education would be the key to transforming my dream into a reality. After graduating from high school, I worked my way through college working with children with special needs. I am the first in my family to obtain a bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees. I have had the honor of teaching grades 1,2,5,6,7 and 8th and this year I have the pleasure of teaching 7th/8th graders.</p>
                    <p>My 20 years of experience as an educator has given me invaluable insights to the needs of students, parents, and school staff. As your current school board trustee, I have used my background and experience in education to be an effective and proactive leader.
